# About

HARFANG®3D is an easy-to-adapt, cross-platform, multi-language, powerful and optimized solution to integrate with embedded systems, into existing environments and combining features to meet the industrial standards of real-time 3D imaging.

The HARFANG®3D architecture makes it easy to meet the requirements for hardware integration, display performance and security.

HARFANG®3D is written in C++ and is based on the open-source bgfx library supporting Vulkan, Metal, DirectX (from 9 to 12), OpenGL and OpenGL ES. It Builds on Windows, Linux, Intel and ARM.

## Building

1. Clone the `Harfang 3D` repository including its submodules.
    ```
    git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/harfang3d/harfang3d.git
    cd harfang3d
    ```

1. Create build directory. Note that the described directory layout is not mandatory.
    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ``` 

1. Clone Fabgen.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ejulien/FABGen.git
    ```

1. Download and install Autodesk FBX SDK.

1. Create a directory that will hold the build system generated by CMake.
    ```
    mkdir cmake
    cd cmake
    ```

1. Generate the build system using CMake. For example, on Windows it will be:
    ```
    cmake ../.. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH="D:/harfang/build/install" \
        -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH="C:/Python36/python.exe" \
        -DHG_FABGEN_PATH:PATH="D:/harfang/build/fabgen" \
        -DHG_FBX_SDK:PATH="D:/fbx_sdk" 
    ``` 

    * `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` specifies the directory where the Harfang SDK will installed.
    * `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` is the path the Python 3 interpreter.
    * `FABGEN_PATH` is the path to Fabgen binding generator.
    * `HG_FBX_SDK` is the path to Autodesk FBX SDK.

    &nbsp;    
    Here is the list of available CMake options.

    * __C++ SDK__
        * `HG_BUILD_CPP_SDK` : Build C++ SDK (default: __OFF__).
        * `HG_BUILD_TESTS`   : Build C++ SDK unit tests (default: __OFF__).
        * `HG_BUILD_DOCS`    : Build API and C++ SDK documentations (default: __OFF__).
        * `HG_ENABLE_BULLET3_SCENE_PHYSICS` : Enable Bullet physics API (default: __ON__).
        * `HG_ENABLE_RECAST_DETOUR_API` : Enable Recast/Detour navigation mesh and path finding API (default: __ON__).
        * `HG_ENABLE_OPENVR_API`   : Enable OpenVR API (default: __OFF__).
        * `HG_ENABLE_SRANIPAL_API` : Enable VIVE Eye and Facial Tracking SDK (SRanipal) API (default: __OFF__).
    * __Tools__
        * `HG_BUILD_ASSETC`             : Build AssetC asset compiler (default: __ON__).
        * `HG_BUILD_ASSIMP_CONVERTER`   : Build Assimp based 3D model converter (default: __ON__).
        * `HG_BUILD_FBX_CONVERTER`      : Build FBX converter (default: __ON__).
        * `HG_BUILD_GLTF_IMPORTER`      : Build GLTF importer (default: __ON__).
        * `HG_BUILD_GLTF_EXPORTER`      : Build GLTF exporter (default: __ON__).
    * __Bindings__
        * `HG_BUILD_HG_LUA`     : Build Harfang LUA module (default: __OFF__).
        * `HG_BUILD_HG_PYTHON`  : Build Harfang Python module (wheel) (default: __OFF__).
        * `HG_BUILD_HG_GO`      : Build Harfang GO module (default: __OFF__).
        
    &nbsp;    

1. Build the SDK.
    ```
    cmake --build . --config Release --target INSTALL
    ```
    _Note: On Linux you will need to explicitly specify the build type with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`_  

    Depending on the set of option passed to CMake the install directory will contain the following subdirectories:
    * `cppsdk` : Harfang C++ SDK.
    * `hg_python` : Harfang Python module.
    * `hg_lua` : Harfang LUA module.
    * `hg_go` : Harfang Go module.
    * `assetc` : Asset compiler.
    * `assimp_converter` : Assimp 3D model converter.
    * `fbx_converter` : FBX converter.
    * `gltf_importer` : GLTF importer.
    * `gltf_exporter` : GLTF exporter.
    
### Notes on Visual Studio Code

1. Install the CMakeTools extension.

1. Copy the `harfang/.vscode/template_settings.json` file to `harfang/.vscode/settings.json` and edit it to reflect your local installation.

1. Open the `harfang` folder in Visual Studio Code. CMakeTools should succesfully configure the project.

# Use the SDK

The Harfang C++ SDK directory `cppsdk` contains the following:
* `bin` : depending on the configuration used, this directory contains either a `Release` or `Debug` subdirectory with all the shared libraries.
* `lib` : like the `bin` directory, it contains a subdirectories named after the configuration used during build (`Release` or `Debug`) with all the generated static libraries.
* `include` : contains all the C++ include files of Harfang public API.
* `cmake` : contains the CMake configuration files. 

To add the Harfang C++ SDK to your CMake project, just add the following to the `CMakeLists.txt` file:
```cmake
find_package(harfang REQUIRED
    COMPONENTS cppsdk
    PATHS ${HG_CPPSDK_PATH}
    NO_DEFAULT_PATH
)
```
with `HG_CPPSDK_PATH` the path to the `cppsdk` directory. For example, if we follow the directory layout given above, it will be `D:/harfang/build/install/cppsdk`.

Targets should link against the following libraries.
* `hg::engine` 
* `hg::foundation` 
* `hg::platform`
* `hg::libluadll`

The `install_cppsdk_dependencies` function installs the Harfang C++ SDK shared libraries dependencies.
```cmake
install_cppsdk_dependencies(destination component)
```
* `destination` : is the library where the shared libraries will be installed.
* `component` : installation component name.
